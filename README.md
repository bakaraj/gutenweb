# Gutenweb

Gutenweb is a typographical stylesheet. It is a CSS file ready to use for quick document generation in html (and epub).

Gutenweb aims to forgot styling when marking-up a document, as you do when you generate a document in LaTeX. It is suitable for not too complex documents

It adds some default styles which prioritize readability and they adapt to screen or print media. A lot of the concepts are taken from [The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web](http://webtypography.net/).

This web page is using Gutenweb (plus, if your rendering engine supports it, background strips to show the vertical rhythm used), so you are right know seeing the look&amp;feel generated. Print to a PDF to look at the print version.
